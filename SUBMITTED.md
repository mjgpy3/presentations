# Pittsburgh TechFest 2016

## This Conference's Obligatory Elm Intro

Elm's a hip, new "JavaScript-Substitute" -- conference speakers everywhere are giving Elm intro talks -- it's TechFest's turn. With JavaScript frameworks being a-dime-a-dozen, Elm takes a radically different approach to front-end development. In this talk, Michael Gilliland will emphasize Elm's developer-friendly philosophy and the benefits it brings, as he introduces the audience to the language and architecture style.

## Property-Based Testing in JavaScript Using JSVerify

Have you ever had production JavaScript bugs because of unexpected edge-cases? Have you written code that you _think_ but don't _know_ works? If that sounds like you, property-based testing with tools like JSVerify can help! Michael Gilliland will enlighten participants as to what property-based testing is, and provide examples of JSVerify in action. He will explain when property-based testing is appropriate and  where it fits with common testing practices.

## Let's Write A Programming Language

Have you ever wanted to write a programming language or just wondered how they work internally? In this fast-paced, JavaScript code and library heavy talk, Michael Gilliland will build an interpreter for what has been called the "simplest, turing-complete programming language:" lambda calculus.

## Vim for N00bs

In this beginner-level talk, Michael Gilliland will introduce some of the concepts behind the Vim editor. Participants will be shown productivity-boosting, common commands as well as some plugins that can make Vim feel more like a familiar IDE. After this talk, participants will feel armed with a powerful, lightweight tool that developers have used for 4 decades.

# Abstractions 2016

## What's Your Source

### Pitch
Attendees will be introduced to a non-trivially powerful pattern: Event
Sourcing. The benefits of (un)structuring data around users actions,
rather than arbitrary relationships, will be shown. Even Event Sourcing veterans
will have plenty to learn about the Event Store Database at this talk.

### Description
Do frail data models make you itch? Has a client ever asked a question yielding the response, _alas dearest client, mine datastore lacketh the richness to generate thy report_? Well, Event Sourcing may be your knight in shining armor!

Let's learn about this glorious pattern with examples using the [Event Store database](https://geteventstore.com/)!

## Refactoring Refactored with Ramda

### Pitch
Refactoring is crucial to clean code. Ramda is an excellent JavaScript
functional programming (FP) enabler. A good practice, plus a cool library
equals max-power! In the example-driven-style of Fowler's classic, participants
will be challenged to rethink refactoring using emergent FP practices.

### Description
Are you always looking for new ways to produce clean code? Or, perhaps,
you're wondering, _what's the big deal about this functional programming
thing?_ Let's relive that nostalgic [Martin Fowler classic](http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672)
but, hey, let's mix in a fresh twist -- let's refactor using the functional
programming library Ramda, in JavaScript!

## You Can't Say "function" Without Saying "data"

### Pitch
We take functions for granted. They seem simple, but are capable of so much.
This talk presents functions as data, closures, point-free, currying, famous
combinators and other function-engendered joys. Attendees will leave
enlightened, itching to further discover the power of functions.

### Description
Functions.

They seem so simple; we know them like the backs of our hands... Or do we?

Join me in the ring. On one side we have functions, the underestimated underdogs. The contender? _Your perception of them._ Watch as the fight unfolds and functions reveal their amazing potential.

This talk will _primarily_ be in JavaScript, but advanced JS knowledge is not required.

## Wait Stop! Put Down the Keyboard!

### Pitch
To many engineers, writing code is a golden hammer and the world is an endless
plane of protruding nails. This talk emphasizes critical thinking and
reasoning over mindlessly monkeying out new features. Themes such as
“programmers as professional problem solvers” are key to professionalism.

### Description
Are you tired of all those nasty production bugs? Are you sick of reading others’ code? With my new one step system, these issues will vanish!

The step is this: don’t write any code.

This may seem ridiculous (and in all honesty it probably is) but let’s explore some ways to make it, at least, closer to being a reality in our professional lives.
