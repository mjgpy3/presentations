# Pittsburgh TechFest 2016

## This Conference's Obligatory Elm Intro

Elm's a hip, new "JavaScript-Substitute" -- conference speakers everywhere are giving Elm intro talks -- it's TechFest's turn. With JavaScript frameworks being a-dime-a-dozen, Elm takes a radically different approach to front-end development. In this talk, Michael Gilliland will emphasize Elm's developer-friendly philosophy and the benefits it brings, as he introduces the audience to the language and architecture style.

## Property-Based Testing in JavaScript Using JSVerify

Have you ever had production JavaScript bugs because of unexpected edge-cases? Have you written code that you _think_ but don't _know_ works? If that sounds like you, property-based testing with tools like JSVerify can help! Michael Gilliland will enlighten participants as to what property-based testing is, and provide examples of JSVerify in action. He will explain when property-based testing is appropriate and  where it fits with common testing practices.

## Let's Write A Programming Language
