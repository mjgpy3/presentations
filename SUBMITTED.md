# Pittsburgh TechFest 2016

## This Conference's Obligatory Elm Intro

Elm's a hip, new "JavaScript-Substitute" -- conference speakers everywhere are giving Elm intro talks -- it's TechFest's turn. With JavaScript frameworks being a-dime-a-dozen, Elm takes a radically different approach to front-end development. In this talk, Michael Gilliland will emphasize Elm's developer-friendly philosophy and the benefits it brings, as he introduces the audience to the language and architecture style.

## Property-Based Testing in JavaScript Using JSVerify

Have you ever had production JavaScript bugs because of unexpected edge-cases? Have you written code that you _think_ but don't _know_ works? If that sounds like you, property-based testing with tools like JSVerify can help! Michael Gilliland will enlighten participants as to what property-based testing is, and provide examples of JSVerify in action. He will explain when property-based testing is appropriate and  where it fits with common testing practices.

## Let's Write A Programming Language

Have you ever wanted to write a programming language or just wondered how they work internally? In this fast-paced, JavaScript code and library heavy talk, Michael Gilliland will build an interpreter for what has been called the "simplest, turing-complete programming language:" lambda calculus.

## Vim for N00bs

In this beginner-level talk, Michael Gilliland will introduce some of the concepts behind the Vim editor. Participants will be shown productivity-boosting, common commands as well as some plugins that can make Vim feel more like a familiar IDE. After this talk, participants will feel armed with a powerful, lightweight tool that developers have used for 4 decades.

# Abstractions 2016

## What's Your Source

### Pitch
Attendees will be introduced to a non-trivially powerful pattern: Event
Sourcing. The benefits of (un)structuring data around users actions,
rather than arbitrary relationships, will be shown. Even Event Sourcing veterans
will have plenty to learn about the Event Store Database at this talk.

### Description
Do frail data models make you itch? Has a client ever asked a question yielding the response, _alas dearest client, mine datastore lacketh the richness to generate thy report_? Well, Event Sourcing may be your knight in shining armor!

Let's learn about this glorious pattern with examples using the [Event Store database](https://geteventstore.com/)!
